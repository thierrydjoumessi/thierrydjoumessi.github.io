  abstract={The present study introduces an advanced multi-physics and multi-scale modeling approach to investigate in silico colon motility. We introduce a generalized electromechanical framework, integrating cellular electrophysiology and smooth muscle contractility, thus advancing a first-of-its-kind computational model of colon motility after intraluminal laser tissue soldering. The proposed theoretical framework comprises three main elements: a microstructural material model describing intestine wall geometry and composition of reinforcing fibers, with four fiber families, two active–conductive and two passive; an electrophysiological model describing the propagation of slow waves, based on a fully-coupled nonlinear phenomenological approach; and a thermodynamical consistent mechanical model describing the hyperelastic energetic contributions ruling tissue equilibrium under diverse loading conditions. The active strain approach was adopted to describe tissue electromechanics, thus solving the governing equations via a staggered finite element scheme. The computational framework was fine-tuned according to state-of-the-art experimental evidence, and extensive numerical analyses were conducted to compare and contrast clinical manometric traces. The model proved capable of reproducing both qualitatively and quantitatively high or low-amplitude propagation contractions demonstrating that material properties of the deposited tissue are critical to restoring a proper peristaltic activity.},

  title={Proposed cardio-pulmonary model to investigate the effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system},
  author={Djoumessi, RT and Vougmo, IP Dongmo and Tegne, JS Tadjonang and Pelap, FB},
  abstract={In this paper, we propose a new mathematical model of cardiovascular system coupled with a respiratory system to study the effects of COVID-19 on global blood circulation parameters using the lumped parameters model. We use the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for solving the sets of equations of motion. We validate our model by showing that the simulated flows in pulmonary and aortic valves corroborate, respectively, the results established by Smith et al. IFAC Pro- ceedings Volumes, 39 (2006) 453–458. Then we examine the effects of the new coronavirus (covid-19) on the cardiopulmonary system through the impact of the high respiratory frequency and the variation of the alveoli volume. To achieve this aim, we propose a new exponential law for the time varying of the pulmonary resistance. It appears that when the respiratory frequency grows, the delay between the systemic artery flow and the flow in the pulmonary artery di- minishes. Therefore, the efficiency of the cardiac pump is reduced. Moreover, our results also show that variations of the alveoli volume cause the increment of the pleural pressure in the vascular cavities that induces an exponential growth of the pulmonary resistance. Furthermore, this growth of the pulmonary resistance provokes the augmentation of pressure in some organs and its reduction in others. We found that patient with covid-19 having a prior history of car- diovascular diseases is exposed to a severe case of inflammation/damage of certain organs than those with no history of cardiovascular disease.},
