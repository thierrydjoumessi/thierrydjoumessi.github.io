  abstract={The present study introduces an advanced multi-physics and multi-scale modeling approach to investigate in silico colon motility. We introduce a generalized electromechanical framework, integrating cellular electrophysiology and smooth muscle contractility, thus advancing a first-of-its-kind computational model of colon motility after intraluminal laser tissue soldering. The proposed theoretical framework comprises three main elements: a microstructural material model describing intestine wall geometry and composition of reinforcing fibers, with four fiber families, two active–conductive and two passive; an electrophysiological model describing the propagation of slow waves, based on a fully-coupled nonlinear phenomenological approach; and a thermodynamical consistent mechanical model describing the hyperelastic energetic contributions ruling tissue equilibrium under diverse loading conditions. The active strain approach was adopted to describe tissue electromechanics, thus solving the governing equations via a staggered finite element scheme. The computational framework was fine-tuned according to state-of-the-art experimental evidence, and extensive numerical analyses were conducted to compare and contrast clinical manometric traces. The model proved capable of reproducing both qualitatively and quantitatively high or low-amplitude propagation contractions demonstrating that material properties of the deposited tissue are critical to restoring a proper peristaltic activity.},

  title={Proposed cardio-pulmonary model to investigate the effects of COVID-19 on the cardiovascular system},
  author={Djoumessi, RT and Vougmo, IP Dongmo and Tegne, JS Tadjonang and Pelap, FB},
  abstract={In this paper, we propose a new mathematical model of cardiovascular system coupled with a respiratory system to study the effects of COVID-19 on global blood circulation parameters using the lumped parameters model. We use the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method for solving the sets of equations of motion. We validate our model by showing that the simulated flows in pulmonary and aortic valves corroborate, respectively, the results established by Smith et al. IFAC Pro- ceedings Volumes, 39 (2006) 453–458. Then we examine the effects of the new coronavirus (covid-19) on the cardiopulmonary system through the impact of the high respiratory frequency and the variation of the alveoli volume. To achieve this aim, we propose a new exponential law for the time varying of the pulmonary resistance. It appears that when the respiratory frequency grows, the delay between the systemic artery flow and the flow in the pulmonary artery di- minishes. Therefore, the efficiency of the cardiac pump is reduced. Moreover, our results also show that variations of the alveoli volume cause the increment of the pleural pressure in the vascular cavities that induces an exponential growth of the pulmonary resistance. Furthermore, this growth of the pulmonary resistance provokes the augmentation of pressure in some organs and its reduction in others. We found that patient with covid-19 having a prior history of car- diovascular diseases is exposed to a severe case of inflammation/damage of certain organs than those with no history of cardiovascular disease.},

  title={Thermoelectric model to study the cardiac action potential and arrhythmias},
  author={Djoumessi, RT and Rafiroiu, Dan-Viorel and Pelap, FB},
  abstract={This paper proposes a new thermoelectric model to examine the behavior of the heart in cooling situations. A modified Karma model with temperature-dependence is exploited to describe the ion exchange dynamics at the mesoscopic scale while the propagation of the action potential is governed by a mono-domain equation at the macroscopic scale. In addition to perfusion and heat metabolism, we call the Penne equation coupled to the mono-domain equation by using the Joule effect to depict the temperature behavior in the system. Galerkin’s finite element method is utilized to start solving the partial differential equations governing the action potential and temperature propagations. The incomplete lower–upper decomposition and generalized minimal residual methods are solicited to solve the resulting nonlinear system. The cases of zero temperature and potential gradients are integrated through the scheme of Runge–Kutta, and the results obtained corroborate well with those of the literature. We analyze the contributions of the nonlinear coupling tensor and arterial temperature on the thermal and electrical responses of the system. The established results reveal that when the temperature in the medium augments, the duration of the action potential decreases and the Joule coupling tensor plays a crucial role in the propagation of the potential. Moreover, we show that temperature and action potential are in phase and that propagation of this potential generates thermal energy. Furthermore, we establish the existence of spiral waves in heart cells and show that the effect of global cooling helps to modulate or dampen these spiral waves, leading to control of the cardiac arrhythmia. This work also develops a technique to resolve conduction disorders and cancel them completely. It exhibits an increased added value to the use of hypothermia as therapy during cardiac arrest and makes it possible to anticipate and perhaps avoid this pathology.},
