René Thierry is currently a researcher at the IMT School for Advanced study in Lucca, Italy. René is working on the mechanics and electrophysiology of soft tissues and is attempting to set up a digital twin of biological organs in order to bridge the gap between medicine, biophysics and bioengineering. 

Finite element modelling, multi-scale modelling and multiphysics are the most important interdependent ingredients I used.
