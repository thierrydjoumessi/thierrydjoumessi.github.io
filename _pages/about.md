René Thierry is currently a researcher at the IMT School for Advanced study in Lucca, Italy. René is working on the mechanics and electrophysiology of soft tissues and is attempting to set up a digital twin of biological organs in order to bridge the gap between medicine, biophysics and bioengineering. 

Finite element modelling, multi-scale modelling and multiphysics are the most important interdependent ingredients I used.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
